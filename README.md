**Introduction:**
	
MakanToday is a mobile application for the people who would like to learn new food recipes from the people on the internet. 
It is also an application for people who are trying to learn new food recipes by following a simple step-by-step instruction an also what are the ingredients needed. 
MakanToday creates a virtual place to exchange recipe with the people around the internet as well. 
This application will come with the following features such as: users can view recipe, user can add/delete recipe, 
user can comment on recipe and user can view videos and photos of the recipe. 

**Objective**
The objective of this application is to be a platform for consumers, food lover to try out new recipes shared by the people with same passion and interest. Discover and try out new culture in cooking around the world, interact with the sharer of those recipes for any inquiries or simply leave a gratification message to them. We also aim to help people by saving their money than spending it for recipe books that eventually will be updated with new recipe every month. This application will become a community for anyone to share their recipe from housewives to renowned chef like sous and pastry chef.

**Features & functionalities**

The app will have few features and functionalities that allows users to navigate the recipes at ease

**Features:**
Features and functions available in this app consist of:-
* View recipes for both registered user and guest.
* Add and delete recipes added by registered user.
* Sort the recipes by category for better search experience.
* Leave comments on the recipeâ€™s comment section for registered user.
* Cooking video on every recipe that we integrated from YouTube.

**Functionalities:**

* **API:** For routing the pages we will use react-navigation and react-navigation-stack libraries, we also would use gesture handler because in the app, we will allow user to perform certain actions with gesture like zooming in on the picture. Our main operation with this application is with user's camera for them to upload a photos or videos from their camera or gallery. So we will use camera API in this project.
* **Components:** React native is using components approach. The basic components will be used the most would be props, states, functions.  Also, another component we wish to use is Alert to notify users if they encounter certain errors or to tell users any updates they made like "Photos uploaded!". For appearance we will use UI Toolkit probably React Native Elements and any other presentational components such as View, Text, Image, Textinput, ScrollView, Stylesheet, Button, SectionList to differentiate area for comments and uploaders post.
* **Error checking** To ensure users does not experience logics or system error. Mainly, we will do error checking in authentication level and check whether users are regisered or not when they attempt to upload new post or comment on other user's post.
* **Authentication** Only autghorized users can login.
* **Firebase for data storage** Storing all the recipes.
* **UI toolkit**
